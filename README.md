This is the repository for all collaborative WeEqualize projects (funded by the ERC starting grant).

The "data-creation" folder compiles and cleans data from various surveys to be used in projects.
The "projects" folder are codes specific to a certain project and analysis, often leveraging data created in the data creation folders.

To properly leverage the macros throughout all of the code here, it is recommended to make your own copy of the setup files in specific folders and replace all of the macros under the "Personal Computer" section with your own file paths.
